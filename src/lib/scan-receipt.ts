 * here so they can't drift apart on any of it.
 *
 * The failures are deliberately distinguished. Previously anything that wasn't
 * a clean JSON error surfaced as "Couldn't reach the server", which sent
 * people to check their wifi when the actual problem was our per-minute
 * quota — or a request that was still running.
