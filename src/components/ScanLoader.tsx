 *
 * The status line steps through what is genuinely happening rather than
 * showing a progress bar: Gemini doesn't stream, so there is no real
 * completion figure to report and any percentage would be invented. The
 * copy advances on a timer and parks on the last line until the request
 * actually returns — it never claims to be finished.
